# Draw Plausible Values from a Fitted Latent Variable Model

Generates plausible values (PVs) for latent abilities based on a fitted
marginal maximum likelihood (MML) or EM-based latent variable model. The
PVs are drawn from subject-specific normal distributions using posterior
mean and variance estimates.

## Usage

``` r
drawPVs(mmlcomp, npv = 10L, verbose = TRUE)
```

## Arguments

- mmlcomp:

  An object returned by a latent variable model fitting function (e.g.,
  `fit_gvem` or a related EM-based estimator), which contains posterior
  summaries of latent abilities.

- npv:

  Integer. Number of plausible values to draw for each subject. Default
  is `10`.

- verbose:

  Logical. If `TRUE`, prints progress information during plausible value
  generation. Default is `TRUE`.

## Value

A data frame containing plausible values, with one row per subject and
`npv` columns corresponding to the generated plausible values.

## Details

Plausible values are generated by sampling from the posterior predictive
distribution of the latent abilities. For each subject, draws are taken
independently from a normal distribution parameterized by the posterior
mean and variance obtained from the fitted model. This approach
propagates measurement uncertainty in secondary analyses.
