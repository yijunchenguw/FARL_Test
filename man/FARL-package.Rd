\title{FARL: Factor-Augmented Regularized Latent Regression for Large-Scale Assessment}
\description{
FARL is developed to support large-scale assessment (LSA) analyses, in which
latent regression models are used to integrate students’ background information
and to generate plausible values (PVs) for secondary analysis. In LSA settings,
background variables are often high-dimensional and highly correlated, posing
substantial challenges for traditional latent regression approaches.
}
\details{
FARL implements factor-augmented regularized latent regression (FARLR), an
innovative framework that jointly models common factors and idiosyncratic
components. Regularization is employed to select relevant idiosyncratic
predictors, yielding interpretable regression results while maintaining
congeniality and estimation stability.
