\title{Draw Plausible Values from a Fitted Latent Variable Model}
\usage{
drawPVs(mmlcomp, npv = 10L, verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{mmlcomp}{An object returned by a latent variable model fitting
function (e.g., \code{fit_gvem} or a related EM-based estimator), which
contains posterior summaries of latent abilities.}

\item{npv}{Integer. Number of plausible values to draw for each subject.
Default is \code{10}.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, prints progress information during
plausible value generation. Default is \code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
A data frame containing plausible values, with one row per subject
  and \code{npv} columns corresponding to the generated plausible values.
}
\description{
Generates plausible values (PVs) for latent abilities based on a fitted
marginal maximum likelihood (MML) or EM-based latent variable model.
The PVs are drawn from subject-specific normal distributions using
posterior mean and variance estimates.
}
\details{
Plausible values are generated by sampling from the posterior predictive
distribution of the latent abilities. For each subject, draws are taken
independently from a normal distribution parameterized by the posterior
mean and variance obtained from the fitted model. This approach propagates
measurement uncertainty in secondary analyses.
